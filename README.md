### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ›  Here I develop software that make life a tiny bit more easier! 

I don't just develop software.
I also:
â€¢ Manage and Administrate Linux/Unraid Servers
â€¢ Find Exploits and Bugs in Software (Mostly iOS SSH bugs)
â€¢ Also work with networking and make the average Router more secure.

## Languages

Here is a table to give a idea of what the programs you will see here will be coded with. 

|        Languages         | Details                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Python                   | Good to make something i thought of quickly 
| C++                      | Used to make a nice GUI program             |
| JavaScript               | Used in websites to make them more fancy    |
| HTML/CSS                 | Making websites and design                  |
